    <h3 class="subtitle is-1">[subtitle]</h3>
    <p>
        I don't have time to do it right now, but I want the adding of todos through the web interface to be as easy as possible
        <br>
        To start out, I want a new todo submission form instead of the generic 'hero' header on every page, or in the nav maybe.
        <br>
        Eventually, I want a keyboard shortcut ANYWHERE on the site to pull up a textbox modal/popup/whatever that behaves exactly like the CLI.
